## Accelerate Deep Learning Hyperparameter Grid Search with Amazon EKS and Weights & Biases

# 1. Overview
Hyperparameter optimization is highly computationally demanding for deep learning models. The architectural complexity increases when a single model training run requires multiple GPUs. In this repo, we will show how to use the Weights & Biases (W&B) Sweeps function and Amazonâ€™s Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to address these challenges. Amazon EKS is a highly available managed Kubernetes service that automatically scales instances based on load, and is well suited for running distributed training workloads.
